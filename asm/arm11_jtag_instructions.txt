===== Â©2011 OpenZeebo =====

1. Start OpenOCD and halt the console within a few milliseconds after powering
it up.
	> openocd -f target/msm7201a_arm9.cfg -c "init" -c "halt"

2. Disable target polling and set a hardware breakpoint at address 0x918870.
	> bp 0x918870 4 hw
	> poll off

3. Resume target. After reaching the breakpoint, load the binary files to RAM.

	- Trampoline shall be loaded at 0x918870:
		> load_image arm11_jtag_trampoline 0x918870 bin

	- Patch shall be loaded at 0x931000:
		> load_image arm11_jtag 0x931000 bin
	
	If the target didn't stop at the breakpoint, the ARM11 has already been
	started. Power off and start again.	
			
4. Resume target.

5. Exit OpenOCD and load it again with ARM11's config script. It will detect the
ARM11 core.

NOTE: There is an issue with the JTAG controller after the main OS has started.
Whether the AMSS is messing with the chain or some misbehavior related to
internal TCK routing (the cores are *NOT* daisy-chained for now, it doesn't
work). Not tested with Wiggler-type dongles.
